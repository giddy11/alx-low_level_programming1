Checking for NULL after memory allocation is a common practice in C programming, especially when using dynamic memory allocation functions like malloc, calloc, and realloc. Here's why it's important to check for NULL after memory allocation:

Memory Allocation Failure: Dynamic memory allocation functions (malloc, calloc, etc.) allocate memory from the heap. If there is not enough available memory to satisfy the allocation request, these functions return a NULL pointer to indicate that the allocation has failed.

Prevent Segmentation Faults: Attempting to dereference a NULL pointer (accessing the me mory it points to) can lead to a segmentation fault or crash, as it's an attempt to access memory that the program doesn't have permission to access.

Graceful Error Handling: Checking for NULL allows your program to gracefully handle cases where memory allocation fails. Instead of the program crashing unexpectedly, you can provide appropriate error messages or take alternative actions to handle the failure.

please can someone explain to me the difference between
int **grid = malloc(height * sizeof(int ));    {What is the size for int* alone}
and
grid[i] = malloc(width * sizeof(int ));
 Assuming height is 4 and width is 6

 
In the original line with int **grid, you are allocating memory for an array of pointers, where each pointer points to a row of integers. This is suitable for creating a two-dimensional array where each row can have a different number of columns.

If you change it to int **grid = malloc(height * sizeof(int));, you are allocating memory for an array of pointers, where each pointer points to an integer. This would still work syntactically, but it's not the typical way to create a two-dimensional array.

The original code with int **grid is the correct approach if you want to create a two-dimensional array where each row can have varying numbers of columns. If you simply allocate memory for an array of integers using int **grid = malloc(height * sizeof(int));, it would represent an array of pointers to individual integers, not a true two-dimensional array.
